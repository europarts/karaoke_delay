# karaoke_delay


Front panel Diptrace board file and GERBER files (zipped) for PT2399-based karaoke delay module that used pre-built Chinese ebay/aliexpress karaoke module.

This will mount the specific karaoke effect module found on ebay with 4 potentiometers.  There are jack holes for input and output 3.5mm jacks along with an extra jack hole labeled 'mod' that can be used for an added jack (add a vactrol maybe) or a toggle switch.
